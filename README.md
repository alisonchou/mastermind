# Master Mastermind


The mastermind game, brought to your browser by
[Master Mastermind](https://mastermastermind.herokuapp.com/)!
Gone are the days of waiting for the other player
to place pegs. Now, you can code-break all on your
own, and our magic will generate the codes, clues,
and hints. ü§Ø

## How to play üñ±Ô∏è

Go to
[mastermastermind.herokuapp.com](https://mastermastermind.herokuapp.com/).

Enter four numbers in the box to guess.
To the right, you can see on the number
of guesses that remain before you lose.

A black dot means that a correct number is in
a **correct** spot. A white dot means that a
correct number is in an **incorrect** spot.

After guessing six times, you can reveal a hint.
That's right; we want to help you win!

![Hint](/screenshots/Hint.PNG 'Hint')

Keep an eye on how much time you've spent
playing. We record your fastest win time.

![Timer](/screenshots/Timer.PNG 'Timer')

At any time, you can start a new game.
The code consists of digits `0-6` in easy
mode and `0-7` in normal mode.

## Behind the "magic" üßê

I built Master Mastermind with `React`.
I chose React for its out-of-the-box
immediate data updates, which were
vital to the game.

Because there were many variables
that needed to be accessed across
the project, I centralized state
with `Redux`. Following game events
(such as winning a game or adding
a guess), I dispatched actions that
updated the store. I used the
`redux-thunk` middleware to run
operations, like generating the
combination, before the action was
dispatched. Adding Redux created
robustness and maintainability.

I tested the Redux reducer and
action creators with `Jest`. In the
reducer tests, I used `deep-freeze`
to ensure that the state I passed
was not modified. In the action
creator tests, I created a mock
store with `redux-mock-store` to
dispatch the actions being tested and
reset the store with `fetch-mock`.

To create the combination, I called the
[Random.org Integer API](https://www.random.org/integers/)
using `axios`. I passed `0` as the min
and `6` or `7` as the max based on
the game mode.

For accuracy, I implemented the timer
with the `Date` object instead of
incrementing my own count. When a
game began, I recorded the start
time. Every second, I updated the
time elapsed by subtracting the
start time from the current time.

Once the user finished or exited the
game, I stopped the time. If the user
won, I checked if their time was faster
than their previous "Best Time" and
updated the record accordingly.

I styled Master Mastermind by using
`styled-components` to add a theme
and add CSS to each component.

### Clues

After each guess, I calculated the correct
numbers (in incorrect location) and correct
placements (correct numbers in correct
location) to show as feedback.

First, I created and iterated through
guess and combination arrays. If the
values at an index were the same, I
incremented the count of correct
placements. I removed the value from
both arrays so that this value would
not be later counted as a correct number.

Next, I iterated through the guess array.
If a value in the guess was also in the
combination, I incremented the count of
correct numbers. I removed the item
from the combination array to prevent
double counting.

### Hints

To generate hints like `3 is not in the code`,
I converted the combination and
latest guess into arrays and sets.
Then, I extracted the numbers from the guess
that were not in the combination.

If all the numbers in the guess were
not in the combination, or the combination
had more unique numbers than the guess,
I created an array of the numbers
not in the guess or combination. I
selected a random number from this
array.

If some but not all numbers in the guess
were not in the combination, I selected
a random number from the previously
calculated array of numbers in the guess
but not the combination.

Then, I informed the player that the
selected number was not in the code.

If the guess consisted of correct
but misplaced numbers, I compared
the guess and combo arrays to create
an array of incorrect positions.
If all the positions were incorrect,
the hint was a correct position.
Otherwise, I displayed an incorrect
position.

### Want to run Master Mastermind locally?

Just run the following commands:

```
> git clone https://github.com/alisonchou/mastermind.git
> cd mastermind
> npm install
> npm start
```

Once you've configured the project,
you can run tests with the command
`npm test` or run the linter with
`npm run lint`.

## Roadmap

### Planning
- Backend
  - Connect `MongoDB` database to
    `Apollo GraphQL` server
  - Accounts
    - Use `bcrypt` and `jsonwebtoken`
      for secure authentication and
      authorization
    - Remember game statistics for
      each user
  - Multiplayer
    - Allow players to compete
      against each other to
      guess the same combination
      in the shortest time
    - Sync player results with
      `GraphQL` subscriptions
- Reducer and action creator
  tests
  - Obtain 100% test coverage
    of `gameReducer.js` and
    `gameActions.js`
- Engineer AI to solve the
  game with
  [increasing digits strategy](https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/a/549)
  and display its steps to
  user

### Done!
- Generate random code
  - Use Random.org API
- Limit attempts to 10 and
  show number of attempts left
- Show history of guesses
- Feedback
  - Display correct numbers
    and correct placements
  - Offer hint on numbers or
    placement after six guesses
- Inform user when they
  win (guess combo) or
  lose (run out of guesses)
- Create configurable difficulty
  level
- Reducer tests
    - Test initial state,
      `START_GAME` and `ADD_GUESS`
- Action creator tests
    - Test `startGame()`
- Game Statistics
  - Count wins and losses
  - Time each game and
    keep track of fastest
    win time
- Styling
  - Create global theme
- Deploy to Heroku
